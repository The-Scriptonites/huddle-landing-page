# Huddle Landing Page – Tailwind CSS Practice

This project is a landing page I built to practice and improve my **Tailwind CSS** skills. It is based on a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-curved-sections-5ca5ecd01e82137ec91a50f2), which features a beautiful design with curved sections.

## 🔧 Features

- Built using **Tailwind CSS**
- **95% responsive** across various screen sizes
- Clean and simple layout for learning and collaboration
- Based on a real-world design challenge

## 🚧 Still a Work in Progress

Although the page is mostly responsive, a few tweaks and enhancements are still needed. I'm continuing to work on it to refine the responsiveness and improve the overall design.

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate

I'm open to feedback and collaboration on this project! If you're interested in contributing or want to build something together, feel free to reach out.
